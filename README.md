# RVCE Campus Runner

A Python game showcasing pathfinding algorithms on RV College of Engineering campus map.

## 🎮 About
Navigate through RVCE campus completing academic tasks while comparing BFS and A* pathfinding algorithms in real-time. Built with Pygame demonstrating 6 core data structures.

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
- **Graph** - Campus navigation network
- **2D Array** - Grid-based map representation  
- **Queue** - BFS algorithm implementation
- **Priority Queue** - A* algorithm with heuristic
- **Stack** - Undo move functionality
- **Hash Map** - Task and building management

## 🎯 Game Features
- Real RVCE campus layout with authentic buildings
- Live algorithm visualization with different path colors
- Academic tasks with riddles and point system
- Real-time scoring and progress tracking
- Time-based challenge mode

## 🚀 Quick Start
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
